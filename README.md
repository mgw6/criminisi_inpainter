# Criminisi Inpainter
Implementation of the inpainting algorithm proposed by [Criminisi et al. (2004)](https://www.irisa.fr/vista/Papers/2004_ip_criminisi.pdf)

Initially this started off as translating [this code](https://github.com/ikuwow/inpainting_criminisi2004) from Matlab to Python. 
However after working with this code it became apparent that it incorrect, although it still was very helpful.

Once it became apprarent that that code was inccorrect, [this other code](https://github.com/ikuwow/inpainting_criminisi2004) 
was references to complete my implementation of Criminisi.
