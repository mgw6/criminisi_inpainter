(First lines; the screen shows a dark background as Lightning McQueen's voice is heard, inhales and exhales deeply)

Lightning McQueen: Okay, here we go. Focus. Speed. I am speed.

(Then, the screen shows some race cars whizzing past on a racetrack, then goes back to dark again)

Lightning McQueen: One winner. 42 losers. I eat losers for breakfast.

(Then, the screen shows McQueen from the back of his left side as his car accelerates and gains on a race car. Then, the screen goes dark again)

Lightning McQueen: Breakfast? Wait, maybe I should have had breakfast? A little breaky could be good for me. No, no, no, stay focused. Speed!

(Then, the screen shows race cars whizzing along the racetrack as the camera moves to the right. The screen then goes dark again)

Lightning McQueen: I'm faster than fast, quicker than quick! I am Lightning!

Mack: (pounds on his trailer door) Hey Lightning, you ready?

Lightning McQueen: (Real Gone plays as the trailer door opens) Oh, yeah. Lightning's ready.
